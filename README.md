# GeoQuiz
Given a qeustion, the user should press true or false, depending on the statement displayed, or cheat if he/she wants to cheat.

The idea behind geo quiz app is to play arround with landscape and portrait layouts and savedInstanceState of the app
This way we can have separate layouts for both orientations and save the information in the app when the phone is rotated,
thus saving which question the user was on after rotating, or if he/she cheated.
